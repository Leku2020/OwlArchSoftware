## Adding/Updating Tools  

### 1. **Adding New Tools**  
1. Create a new directory under `objective/` for your tool.  
   ```bash
   mkdir objective/my-new-tool
   ```
2. Add your tool's source code and a `README.md` file explaining its purpose and usage.  
3. Update the `pages/` directory with relevant documentation for your tool.  

### 2. **Customizing Existing Tools**  
- Modify the source code in the respective `objective/` directory.  
- Update the documentation in `pages/` to reflect the changes.
